We will study ML using JBNU ML materials and Hands-on-machine learning. (It can be changed anytime)

Hands-on-machine learning is too large, so could not upload this repo.
Please download materials through our study kakao talk, or [here](https://www.knowledgeisle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-Aurélien-Géron-Hands-On-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-Tensorflow_-Concepts-Tools-and-Techniques-to-Build-Intelligent-Systems-O’Reilly-Media-2019.pdf,"Hands-on-machineLearning.pdf")

The Others are reference ML materials to study
